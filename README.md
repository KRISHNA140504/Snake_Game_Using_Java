# Snake_Game_Using_Java
Hi this is code for my project 1 in java where I have worked on building a snake game 
“Snake Game in Java” is a classic arcade game fully coded in Java. 
The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing in size.
The objective of the game is to guide the snake to eat as much food as possible without running into the walls or its own tail. 
The game is simple to play but challenging to master, making it a perfect choice for players of all skill levels.
With smooth graphics and responsive controls, “Snake Game in Java” is sure to provide hours of entertainment.
Give it a try and see how high you can score! 🐍
